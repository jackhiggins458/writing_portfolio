While I used spare time in my workday to help create learning material for colleagues at the ABS (see my [Interactive neural networks tutorial]( {{< relref "nn_tutorial.md" >}} ) piece), the bulk of my day was spent doing analysis, reporting and documentation.

In one project, I was responsible for working with staff in the international trade team on developing and documenting a new methodology for analysing Australian exporters. While in this case [the actual analysis of the data was left to the international trade team](https://www.abs.gov.au/statistics/economy/international-trade/characteristics-australian-exporters/latest-release), I delivered the associated methodology report, which documents the key concepts, methods and data sources used in the analysis.

Subject matter experts were the intended audience for this report, so I was able to dive quite deeply into the technical concepts and methods associated with the analysis. That said, there were some stakeholders with less expertise in this area, so still attempted to provide enough context to make the report accessible to a wider range of stakeholders in the trade statistics space.

I followed ABS style guidelines in the writing and formatting of this report.
