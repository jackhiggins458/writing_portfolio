While I made time to work on learning material for the Machine Learning Community of Practice (see my [Interactive machine learning tutorial]( {{< relref "nn_tutorial.md" >}} ) piece) where I could, my day to day role as a data scientist at the Australian Bureau of Statistics more often involved analysis, reporting and documentation.

In one project, I was responsible for developing and documenting a new methodology for analysing Australian exporters. While in this case [the actual analysis of the data](https://www.abs.gov.au/statistics/economy/international-trade/characteristics-australian-exporters/latest-release) was left to subject matter experts in a different team, I built the data pipelines, designed the methodology and wrote the associated methodology report. 

In this report, I:

- Documented key concepts and definitions.
- Highlighted when methods used in this analysis differed from methods used in similar analyses.
- Detailed what data sources were used, and, where necessary, why they were chosen. 
- Met quality declaration requirements, as required by the Bureau's publishing framework.

Subject matter experts were the primary audience for this report, so I dove deeply into the technical concepts and definitions. However, we expected that some readers in trade statistics space would have less expertise in this area, so I attempted to provide enough context to make the report accessible to a wider range of professionals.

I followed ABS style guidelines in the writing and formatting of this report.
