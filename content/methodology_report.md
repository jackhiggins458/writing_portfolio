While I used whatever leftover time I could find in my day to help create learning material for colleagues at the ABS (see my [Interactive neural networks tutorial]( {{< relref "nn_tutorial.md" >}} ) piece), the bulk of my time was spent doing analysis and reporting.

In one project, I was responsible for working with staff in the international trade team on developing and documenting a new methodology for analysing Australian exporters. While in this case [the actual analysis of the data was left to the international trade team](https://www.abs.gov.au/statistics/economy/international-trade/characteristics-australian-exporters/latest-release), I delivered the associated methodology report, which the key concepts, methods and data sources used.

Subject matter experts were the intended audience for this report, allowing me to dive deeply into the technical concepts and methods associated with this analysis. That said, I also attempted to provide enough context to make the report accessible to a wider audience.
