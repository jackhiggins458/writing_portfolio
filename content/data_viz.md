I love communicating through writing, but some situations call for something more visual.

I graduated with a Bachelor of Science, majoring in both mathematics and computational science, including studies in algorithmics and data visualisation. My love of maths, data visualisation and Wikipedia bore this "Mathematicians of Wikipedia" visualisation.

The inspiration for this page came from a collision of different interests at the time:

- I was implementing some graph/network algorithms in Python, and wanted to use them visualise something interesting.
- I wanted to try the [Vega Lite](https://vega.github.io/vega-lite/) graphics library, and learn the basics of HTML.
- I was interested in the history of mathematics, and was reading a randomly selected mathematician's Wikipedia page each day.

While I wouldn't consider this visualisation to be a particularly good piece of writing (I like to think my writing has improved significantly since university!), I'm still proud of the passion that was channelled into this work, and  still serves as a reminder that the written word is only one amongst many tools we have in the communication toolbox.
