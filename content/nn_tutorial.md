In my first role after graduating from university, I worked as a data scientist at the Australian Bureau of Statistics. At the Bureau, I was an active member of the Machine Learning Community of Practice, a group open to all staff interested in learning about machine learning. 

In 2021, the Bureau begun using more machine learning methods in statistical production processes. Consequently, there was a large influx of staff joining the community of practice, many of whom didn't have much experience with machine learning. To help upskill new community members, three colleagues and I organised a series of introductory machine learning talks and tutorials. 

While my colleagues worked on talks, I wanted facilitate a more interactive learning experience. To do so, I authored these hands-on tutorials, guiding new members through:

- Navigating computational notebook environments. 
- Programming fundamentals in the [R](https://www.r-project.org/) programming language.
- Implementing and testing a [neural network](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neural_network_(machine_learning)), a popular machine learning model.

These tutorials were:

- Designed to be approachable for staff with limited background in programming and machine learning, whilst also containing enough depth to engage more experienced members.
- Sequenced to follow after my colleagues' more theoretical talks, progressively building up to a rewarding capstone task â€” coding a neural network.
- Written in Markdown and R code using [Jupyter Notebooks](https://jupyter.org/).
- Intended to be followed interactively on [Binder](https://mybinder.org/) in a group setting, with the support of a more experienced facilitator.
