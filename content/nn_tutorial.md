In my first role after graduating from university, I worked as a data scientist at the Australian Bureau of Statistics. At the Bureau, I was an active member of the Machine Learning Community of Practice, a group open to all staff interested in learning about machine learning. 

In 2021, the Bureau begun using more machine learning methods in statistical production processes. Consequently, there was a large influx of staff joining the community of practice, many of whom didn't have much experience with machine learning. To help upskill new community members, three colleagues and I organised a series of introductory machine learning talks and tutorials. 

While my colleagues worked on talks, I wanted facilitate a more interactive learning experience. To do so, I authored these hands-on tutorials, guiding new members through:

- Navigating [computational notebook environments](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Notebook_interface). 
- Programming fundamentals in the [R](https://www.r-project.org/) programming language.
- Implementing and testing a [neural network](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neural_network_(machine_learning)), a popular machine learning model.

These tutorials were:

- Designed to be approachable for staff with limited background in programming and machine learning, whilst also containing enough depth to engage more experienced members.
- Sequenced to follow after my colleagues' more theoretical talks, progressively building up to a rewarding capstone task â€” coding a neural network.
- Written in Markdown and R code using [Jupyter Notebooks](https://jupyter.org/).
- Intended to be followed interactively on [Binder](https://mybinder.org/) in a group setting, with the support of a more experienced facilitator.
- Updated multiple times after seeking feedback from participants.

I facilitated these tutorials once in 2021 and again in 2022, and received a significant amount of positive (as well as constructive) feedback from participants about their experience.

[^1]: Unfortunately, Binder sometimes seems take five to ten minutes to launch (and occasionally fails to launch at all). If you're having trouble launching the interactive Binder, try viewing the tutorial on GitHub instead. Please note however that the GitHub preview of the notebooks has a few issues. For example, `$` characters in code blocks are incorrectly interpreted as the start of a [LaTeX](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/LaTeX) command, causing some of the surrounding formatting to render incorrectly.
