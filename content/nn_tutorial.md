After graduating university, I began working as a data analyst at Australia's national statistical agency, the Australian Bureau of Statistics.

At the Bureau of Statistics, I was involved in the Machine Learning Community of Practice, a special interest group that staff members could join to discuss and learn more about machine learning. 

At the time, there was growing interest from staff in machine learning, as it was beginning to be used more in statistical production. As a result, we were seeing an uptick in the number of new members to the community, many of whom didn't have much experience with machine learning.

To help upskill new members, three colleagues and I organised a series of introductory machine learning talks and tutorials. While my other colleagues worked on talks, I wanted to help members learn in a more interactive fashion. To do so, I authored three hands-on tutorials to introduce computational notebooks, programming in [R](https://www.r-project.org/) and neural networks (a particular machine learning method).

These tutorials were:

- Designed to be approachable for people with a wide range of backgrounds and experiences. 
- Sequenced to progressively build to a rewarding "capstone" task of coding up a neural network.
- Written in Markdown and R code using [Jupyter Notebooks](https://jupyter.org/).
- Intended to be followed interactively on [Binder](https://mybinder.org/) in a group setting, with the support of a more experienced facilitator.

Unfortunately, Binder sometimes seems take five to ten minutes to launch (and occasionally fails to launch at all). If you're having trouble loading the interactive Binder, please view the tutorial on GitHub using the link at the top of this page.
