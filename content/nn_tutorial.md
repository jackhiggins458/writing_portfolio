In my first role after graduating university, I worked as a data analyst at Australia's national statistical agency, the Australian Bureau of Statistics (ABS).

At the ABS, I was involved in the machine learning community of practice (ML CoP). At the time, there was growing interest from staff in machine learning methods, as many such methods were beginning to see use in statistical production. As a result, we had a large increase in new members to the community, many of whom didn't have much of a background in machine learning.

To help upskill new ML CoP members, three colleagues and I organised a series of introductory machine learning talks and tutorials. I wanted to help students learn by doing, so I authored these hands-on tutorials to introduce computational notebooks, programming and neural networks fundamentals, that progressively build to coding up a simple neural network from scratch.

These tutorials were written using [Jupyter Notebooks](https://jupyter.org/) and are designed to be followed interactively using [Binder](https://mybinder.org/). 

Unfortunately, Binder currently seems to be very slow to launch (and sometimes fails to launch at all). If you're having trouble loading the interactive Binder, please view the tutorial on GitHub.
