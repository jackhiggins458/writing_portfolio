After graduating university, I began working as a data analyst at Australia's national statistical agency, the Australian Bureau of Statistics (ABS).

At the ABS, I was involved in the Machine Learning Community of Practice (ML CoP), a special interest group that staff members could join to discuss and learn more about machine learning (ML) methods. 

At the time, there was growing interest from staff in ML, as many such methods were beginning to see use in statistical production. As a result, we were seeing an uptick in the number of new members to the community, many of whom didn't have much of a background in machine learning.

To help upskill new members, three colleagues and I organised a series of introductory machine learning talks and tutorials. While my other colleagues worked on talks, I wanted to help members learn more interactively. To do so, I authored three hands-on tutorials to introduce computational notebooks, programming in R and neural networks fundamentals. These tutorials were designed to be accessible people with a wide range of backgrounds and experiences, and to progressively build up to a "capstone" task of implementing a simple neural network in R.

These tutorials were written using [Jupyter Notebooks](https://jupyter.org/) and are intended to be followed interactively using [Binder](https://mybinder.org/) in small groups with facilitator support.

Unfortunately, Binder seems to sometimes take five to ten minutes to launch (and sometimes fails to launch at all). If you're having trouble loading the interactive Binder, please view the tutorial on GitHub.
