## Portfolio ðŸŒ±

Hi there! I'm Jack (he/they). You've stumbled across my technical writing portfolio. Welcome! 

As a data scientist and support technician, I've authored many pieces of technical communication. Here's a few that I'm proud of: 
- [Interactive machine learning tutorial]( {{< relref "nn_tutorial.md" >}} )
- [Australian exporter analysis methodology]( {{< relref "methodology_report.md" >}})
- [Customer support responses]( {{< relref "customer_responses.md" >}} )
- [DNS record change guide]( {{< relref "customer_comms.md" >}} )
