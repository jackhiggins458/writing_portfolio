## Portfolio ðŸŒ±

Hi there! I'm Jack. You've stumbled across my technical writing portfolio. Welcome! 

As a data analyst and support technician, I've authored many technical documents. I'm particularly proud of the following attempts at documentation and communication.
- [Interactive neural networks tutorial]( {{< relref "nn_tutorial.md" >}} )
- [Exporter analysis methodology report]( {{< relref "methodology_report.md" >}})
- [Technical support responses]( {{< relref "customer_responses.md" >}} )
- [DNS record change guide]( {{< relref "customer_comms.md" >}} )
- [Wikipedia mathematicians data visualisation]( {{< relref "data_viz.md" >}} )
