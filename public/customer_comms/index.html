<p>As mentioned in <a href="/customer_responses/">Technical support responses</a>, I currently work in Support at <a href="https://www.fastmail.com/">Fastmail</a>.</p>
<p>Thousands of customers use Fastmail to host one or more simple static websites. Due to some changes to Fastmail&rsquo;s internal networks, the IP addresses that users&rsquo; websites were hosted on were scheduled for change. We could make these changes automatically for customers hosting their DNS at Fastmail, but we needed those who were not to manually update DNS records at their host.</p>
<p>I wrote a set of guides, emailed out to over a thousand customers, to explain the situation and the required steps to affected customers.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve pasted a (redacted) copy of one of the messages that was sent out below. This particular message would have been sent to any customer with one website hosted at Fastmail, and where we detected that the DNS was hosted by Cloudflare.</p>
<p>Due to the wide variety of DNS hosts and configurations used by our users, I wrote multiple sets of steps for six of the most commonly used DNS hosts. This allowed us to provide specific, step by step instructions to the large majority of Fastmail users. Users not hosting their domain on these any of these six hosts received a generic set of instructions instead.</p>
<hr>
<blockquote>
<p>Dear <strong>$customer_name</strong>,</p>
<p>Our systems show that you are currently hosting a website on your Fastmail account. They also show that the DNS for this website is hosted at an external DNS provider (Cloudflare). As a result of some scheduled technical changes on our end, we’ll need you to update the DNS records for this domain at your external DNS provider to continue hosting these websites at Fastmail.</p>
<p>When you host a website at the root (or apex) of your domain, you have to enter the IP addresses of the web server hosting your website. Because you are using an external DNS provider for your domain, you entered the IP addresses of the Fastmail web server on the external DNS provider&rsquo;s control panel. These IP addresses are changing, and you will need to update them at your external DNS provider by <strong>$current_date + 2 months</strong>.</p>
<p>We have identified the following domains that need updating:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>$example.tld</strong></li>
</ul>
<p>As mentioned above, the DNS for this domain appears to be hosted by Cloudflare. Cloudflare supports a feature called &ldquo;CNAME flattening&rdquo;, which we recommend using instead of specific IP addresses.</p>
<p>To set this up, please follow these steps:</p>
<ol>
<li>Log in to your <a href="https://dash.cloudflare.com/login">Cloudflare dashboard</a> and select an account.</li>
<li>Find the <strong>$example.tld</strong> domain and click on it.</li>
<li>Go to <strong>DNS &gt; DNS Records</strong> at the top right of the screen.</li>
<li>For each <strong>$example.tld</strong> record, you should see one or more A type records with content of the form <strong>$current_ip</strong> .</li>
<li>If there is more than one A type record for <strong>$example.tld</strong> , click <strong>Edit</strong> and then <strong>Delete</strong> on each of them until there is only one A record left.</li>
<li>Click <strong>Edit</strong> on the final A record for <strong>$example.tld</strong>.</li>
<li>Change the <strong>Type</strong> to <strong>CNAME</strong> .</li>
<li>Change the <strong>Target</strong> to <strong>web.fastmail.com</strong>.</li>
<li>Ensure <strong>Proxy status</strong> is <strong>DNS only</strong>.</li>
<li>Click <strong>Save</strong>.</li>
</ol>
<p>The DNS for your domain will now point to our new IP addresses. These changes should not cause any interruption to the access of your website.</p>
<p>Please note that if the described changes are not made by <strong>$current_date + 2 months</strong>, your domain will no longer point to your website content, and the website will no longer be accessible via the domain. This means that anyone who entered <strong>$example.tld</strong> online would not be able to view your website.</p>
<p>If you have any questions or concerns about this change, or any of the steps you need to take, please reply to this message and our Support team will be happy to assist.</p>
