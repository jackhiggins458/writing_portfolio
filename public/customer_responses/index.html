<h2 id="request-1-whats-wrong-with-my-dkim-setup">Request 1: What&rsquo;s wrong with my DKIM setup?</h2>
<blockquote>
<p>Hello Fastmail Support WIzards!</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m trying to set up another domain (example.com) in my Fastmail account, but I seem to be having issues getting the DKIM records to be accepted/marked as verified by Fastmail. I&rsquo;ve set up the authoritative DNS (Cloudflare) as specified in your documentation, and it matches the configuration used by my other domains set up in Fastmail. Could you please have a look and let me know if I&rsquo;m missing something? All other record types show as verified successfully.</p>
<p>Configuration of the Cloudflare Zone is managed by Terraform.</p>
<p>Please see the attached screenshots of my DNS record configuration in the Cloudflare control panel.</p>
<p>Cheers,</p>
<p><strong>$customer_name</strong></p>

<h2 id="response-1-disable-cname-flattening">Response 1: Disable CNAME flattening</h2>
<blockquote>
<p>Hello <strong>$customer_name,</strong></p>
<p>Thank you for reaching out to Fastmail support! I&rsquo;m sorry to hear you&rsquo;re having issues with your DKIM records for <code>example.com</code>, but I&rsquo;m happy to assist.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve taken a look at your existing DNS configuration for <code>example.com</code>, and I can see that your three DKIM records appear to be set as required. However, as you note, they don&rsquo;t seem to be resolving correctly. We sometimes see domains hosted on Cloudflare flattening CNAME records, which can cause issues. This is mentioned briefly in our Cloudflare help article: <a href="https://www.fastmail.help/hc/en-us/articles/1500000277962-Adding-MX-records-to-Cloudflare">https://www.fastmail.help/hc/en-us/articles/1500000277962-Adding-MX-records-to-Cloudflare</a>.</p>
<p>While I can see in the attached screenshot that you have CNAME flattening disabled for each of these DKIM records individually, some Cloudflare accounts have an option that enables flattening for all CNAME records added to a zone.</p>
<p>As a first troubleshooting step, may I suggest that you log into your Cloudflare account to check if the <strong>CNAME flattening for all CNAME records</strong> option is turned on for the relevant zone? The steps required to do so are described in the following Cloudflare article: <a href="https://developers.cloudflare.com/dns/cname-flattening/set-up-cname-flattening/">https://developers.cloudflare.com/dns/cname-flattening/set-up-cname-flattening/</a>.</p>
<p>If this option is enabled, please try disabling it, which I believe this should resolve the issue.</p>
<p>Please let me know how this goes. If this option isn&rsquo;t enabled, also let me know, and I&rsquo;ll be happy to continue troubleshooting.</p>

<h2 id="support-request-2-why-is-my-spf-record-failing">Support request 2: Why is my SPF record failing?</h2>
<blockquote>
<p>Hi,</p>
<p>Can I clarify something with you? This is about SPF.</p>
<p>I want to be able to send mail from other mail servers (Cloudflare and Google), in addition to Fastmail&rsquo;s. Where do I put those server details? Do I need to add them to my existing SPF record, or should I create a new one?</p>
<p>I currently merged my existing records into one SPF record for example.com:</p>
<pre tabindex="0"><code>v=spf1 include:_spf.mx.cloudflare.net include:spf.fastmail.com include:mxlogin.com include:_spf.google.com ?all
</code></pre><p>However, Fastmail gives me an error for this record. Please advise.</p>
<p><strong>$customer_name</strong></p>
</blockquote>
<h2 id="response-2-not-valid-adjust-record">Response 2: Not valid, adjust record</h2>
<blockquote>
<p>Hello <strong>$customer_name</strong>,</p>
<p>Thanks for getting back in touch with Fastmail support. I&rsquo;m happy to clarify.</p>
<p>Merging your separate Sender Policy Framework (SPF) records into a singular record was the right choice here, as an SPF record will only work if it is the only one detected for a domain.</p>
<p>The issue in this case is that the SPF specification requires the number of lookups for each record to be at most 10. This is specified in the official SPF specification, which you can view here: <a href="https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc4408#section-10.1">https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc4408#section-10.1</a></p>
<blockquote>
<p>SPF implementations MUST limit the number of mechanisms and modifiers that do DNS lookups to at most 10 per SPF check, including any lookups caused by the use of the &ldquo;include&rdquo; mechanism or the &ldquo;redirect&rdquo; modifier.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>While on first glance it may appear that your SPF record has less than 10 lookups (as your record only specifies four &ldquo;include&rdquo; mechanisms), there are actually 11 lookups, as some of these &ldquo;include&rdquo; mechanisms recurse back to additional &ldquo;include&rdquo; mechanisms when queried.</p>
<p>I note that you want to be able to send via Fastmail, Google and Cloudflare. Do you also need to be able to send via mxlogin.com? If not, I recommend you remove the <code>include:mxlogin.com</code> mechanism from your SPF record, as doing so will bring the number of lookups below 10,  resolving the error you&rsquo;re seeing.</p>
<p>Please let me know how you go with this.</p>
